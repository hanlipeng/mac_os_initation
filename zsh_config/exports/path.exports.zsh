# Zsh Path Configuration
# ------------------------
#
# This file is for managing your shell's PATH variable.
# The PATH variable is a list of directories where the shell looks for executable programs.

# Example: Add your custom scripts directory to the PATH
#
# If you have a directory of your own scripts, like `~/my_scripts`,
# you can make them executable from anywhere by adding this line:
#
# export PATH="$HOME/my_scripts:$PATH"

# Add user's custom bin directory to PATH (a common convention)
export PATH="$HOME/.bin:$PATH"
